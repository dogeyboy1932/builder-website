# Product Requirements Document: Website Code Refactoring

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive refactoring of the personal website codebase. The primary goal is to simplify the existing code, improve performance, enhance modularity, and create a cleaner, more maintainable foundation for future development. The project will focus on minimizing code and file duplication while adhering to a futuristic design aesthetic.

## 2. Goals

- **Improve Performance:** Enhance the website's loading speed and overall performance.
- **Simplify Future Development:** Create a modular and well-documented codebase that is easy for developers to understand and extend.
- **Enhance Visuals:** Improve the website's look and feel to be more modern and visually appealing.
- **Increase Modularity:** Decouple components and logic to allow for easier reuse and modification.
- **Reduce Codebase Size:** Minimize the number of files and lines of code without sacrificing functionality, aiming for a 40% reduction in file count.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a developer, I want to...**
  - ...have a fully working website that I can continue to iterate on without difficulty in navigating the codebase.
  - ...have a clear separation of concerns, with content, components, and pages organized logically.
  - ...be able to add new features, components, and animations with minimal effort and code changes.
  - ...have all constants and content managed in the `@src/constants/` directory to avoid hard-coded values.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Code Consolidation:**
    - Reduce the number of files by at least 40%.
    - Consolidate styles, components, and routes where possible to reduce complexity.
2.  **Modularity:**
    - Refactor the codebase to be highly modular, with reusable components and functions.
    - Ensure that components are self-contained and do not have tightly coupled dependencies.
3.  **Centralized Constants:**
    - All hard-coded content, such as project names, links, and other variables, must be moved to the `@src/constants/` directory.
    - The application must fetch all content from this directory.
4.  **Consistent Design:**
    - All changes and additions must conform to the existing futuristic design and layout.
    - The UI should be clean, intuitive, and visually appealing.
5.  **Performance Optimization:**
    - Optimize assets and code to improve load times.
    - Implement performance best practices for SvelteKit applications.
6.  **Continuous Integration:**
    - Ensure the website boots up correctly without any compile or runtime errors after every significant change.
    - Use Git for version control, with regular commits to save progress.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Database Integration:** This refactoring will not include any database schema changes or integration.
- **Major Feature Additions:** While the refactoring should make it easier to add features, this project will not focus on building new features.

## 6. Design Considerations

- **Theme:** The website should maintain its futuristic theme.
- **Layout:** The existing layout and structure should be preserved and enhanced.
- **UI/UX:** The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- **Framework:** The website is built with SvelteKit.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
- **Code Quality:** The code should be well-documented with comments where necessary.

## 8. Success Metrics

- **File Reduction:** A 40% or greater reduction in the total number of files.
- **Performance Score:** Improved Lighthouse scores for performance, accessibility, and SEO.
- **Developer Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from developers on the improved codebase.
- **Code Complexity:** A reduction in code complexity metrics.

## 9. Open Questions

- Are there any specific performance metrics we should be targeting?
- Are there any particular areas of the code that are known to be problematic?
